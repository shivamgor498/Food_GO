The advertisements published on the FoodGo Platform are independent of the reviews recieved by such advertisers. We are a neutral platform and we don't arbitrate disputes, however in case if someone writes a review that the restaurant does not consider to be true, the best option for the restaurant representative would be to contact the reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any misunderstandings. If the Restaurant believes that any particular user's review violates any of the FoodGo' policies, the restaurant may write to us at neutrality@FoodGo.com and bring such violation to our attention. FoodGo may remove the review in its sole discretion if review is in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or otherwise harmful to the Services</p>
